Algorithm Analysis:

Exercise1412.java
n is the smaller of the lengths of a[] and b[]
O(n), since in the worst case the
algorithm goes entirely through only the smaller of the arrays
(or both if they're the same length)

Exercise1418.java
n is the size of a[]
O(log(n)), because the space searched in the
array is halved each time an index is checked

StringPatternMatcher.java
n is the length of the String being searched
O(n), because the string is searched linearly, and at 
each index a calculation is done that does not depend on the length 
of either string

TrailingZeros.java
O(log(n)^2), because the while() loop runs log(n) times,
and at each run of the loop a calculation is done that is log(n) 
(I am assuming that Math.log() runs in O(log(n)) )
